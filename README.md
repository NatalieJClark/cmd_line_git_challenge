# Command Line & Git Challenge

## Introduction
- This is my repo for the Makers Module 1 - Command Line & Git Challenge

## Objectives
I used this challenge to practise:
- [x] Using the command line to create a basic project structure
- [x] Enabling version control (git)
- [x] Uploading my project structure to a remote host (GitHub)

## Setup
- No setup needed ... this repo was purely to practise my new command line and version control skills!
